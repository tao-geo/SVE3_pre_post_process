Running CitcomSVE 3.0 with preprocess and postprocess scripts.



# I. Step 1: do preprocess in ./preprocess_initial/

Goal: Generate ocean functions and "grounded ice load (plus topo correction, see Yuan, Zhong, A 2025, or Kendall et al, 2005)" based on user's ice model and the present-day topography.

## I.1 Required files

- original ice model files: User-provided ice model files, should be on CitcomSVE input grid. (e.g. ICE6G_original in this case)
- topo file: the present day topography model, also on CitcomSVE input grid. (e.g. ETOPO1+bedmap2_180x360.txt)

in this folder, we have the ICE6G_original/ice* files which are generated from ICE6G_D ice model (IceT.I6F_C.131QB_VM5a_1deg.nc downloaded from Peltier's website) using ./gen_ascii_from_nc.sh (a bash script).

## I.2 steps

- run make to compile precalc_oceanfunc.c
- prepare "preprocess.input" file, the input file for precalc_oceanfunc. See instructions in it.
- run `run.sh`.

After those steps, the load and ocean function files are generated in the directory specified by user.


# II. Step 2: run CitcomSVE using ice and ocean files generated from Step 1.

See user manual for CitcomSVE3.0.



# III. Step 3: postprocess, cumulative displacement and geoid and their rate on regular grids, and RSL for sites

in postprocess directory.

1. run `make` to compile files.
2. modify and run `bash run_all_postp.sh`. See notes in run_all_postp.sh for parameters.


# IV. (optional) Step 4: refine ocean function (and grounded ice load)

See Yuan et al, 2025, in review or Kendall et al., 2005 for details about running multiple iterations for topography iteration.


Similar to Step 1,
1. run  `make` to compile files
2. modify `refine_oceanfunc.input` and `run_all.sh`, run run_all.sh with bash , see notes in both files for details.
